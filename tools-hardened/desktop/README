Kernel Requirements:
====================

On the host system, these packages need to be installed:

* sys-kernel/hardened-sources-4.0.4-r2
* >=sys-kernel/linux-firmware-20131230
* sys-kernel/genkernel

Once you emerge these things, create a symbolic link of the hardened-sources
to point to "/usr/src/linux-tinhat".

After this you need to apply the Loop-AES patch by doing the following:

* cp ./configs/loop-AES-kernel.patch /usr/src/linux-tinhat/

Then apply the patch:

* rm -f drivers/block/loop.c include/linux/loop.h
* patch -p1 < loop-AES-kernel.patch

Stage 3 tarball:
================
TinHat relies on a stage 3 tarball as it's seed to begin the chroot.
By default, it expects to see the tarball in:
"/var/tmp/catalyst/builds/hardened/amd64/stage3-amd64-hardened-latest.tar.bz2"
You can however inform TinHat of your own location of choice by passing it
as an environment variable: "STAGE3".

To run:
=======
ex.) STAGE3="/ministry/of/silly/walks/evil-rabbit.tar.bz2" ./<DM>-run.sh

or without the STAGE3 environment variable.

ex.) ./<DM-run.sh

Where <DM> is a desktop manager of three flavors of choice:

* Fluxbox
* Gnome3
* Xfce4

When your ISO is built, you can clean up by removing the th-<ARCH>-<DM>/
directory as it is no longer needed.

Enjoy! ;)
